# bills-downloader-ireland
Selection of scripts you can use to download utility bills from some companies in Ireland

Here you will find scripts for:
- Virgin Media Ireland
- Three Ireland - Soon...
- SSE Aitricity Ireland - Soon...

Initially, they are for Node.js, but I have plans to have Bash or PowerShell versions of them, if anyone needs that (let me know).

## Virgin Media Ireland Bill Downloader (Node.js Script)

Company: _Virgin Media Ireland_

File name: `virgin-media-ireland.mjs`

This script downloads all your Virgin Media bills in PDF format, even if they're no longer available through the website.

âœ… What you need to do:
1. Get your *token* and *account number* from the Virgin Media website.
2. Set those values (along with the desired start year) in the config section of the script.
3. Run the script using: `node virgin-media-ireland.mjs`

The script will fetch bills from your chosen start year up to the current year. Any errors encountered will be saved in the file `Errors found.txt`.

ðŸ”‘ How to get your token:
- Log in to the Virgin Media website.
- Open your browser's DevTools (press F12), then go to the Console tab.
- Run the following command and copy the result:
  
    `localStorage["lgi-oidc-uxp-idToken"] + ',Atmosphere atmosphere_app_id="AEM_IE"'`
- The token will be valid for about 20 minutes. If it expires, repeat the step above.

ðŸ’¡ This code was tested with Node.js version 22, but should work in other versions too
